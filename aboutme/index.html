    <p>Hello! My name is Abraham, and that is a picture of me and my wife. I'm from Mexico City and I love learning new things, I came back from my mission in 2020 and got married at the end of the same year, when I came back I was feeling a bit lost, I had a plan but sooner than later I started feeling that what I initially planned wasn't what I really wanted, so with the help of the Lord and my wife I decided to enroll in Pathway and as you may guess I'm really enjoying the program. </p>
    <p>I've worked in the IT field since I came back from my mission so it seems like everything is coming together now. </p>
    <p>One of the best lessons I've learned so far is that the Lord's timing is perfect and that processes are important, feeling lost and without a clear answer is sometimes part of the process and that's ok. I recently discovered Yoga and I'm liking the challenging but chill parts of it all.  Thanks for looking at my project.</p>
