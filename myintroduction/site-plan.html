      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>It's very important for me to be recognized by my work. What's the best presentation card I could possibly give as a web developer and designer? Making my own presentation site is a great way to show my skills and knowledge through this informational website. Here is a website that can be my perrsonal gallery of projects, a place to show the world what I'm capable of doing and showcase future ideas. This page will be the first thing that potential employers see, so I want it to clearly indicate that I am capable of handling their needs.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page is all about catching the eye of potential employers and people who might be interested in my me as a web designer, since this is the first thing they'll be seeing when they visit my website I need to make sure that is interesting, well designed and eye appealing. People won't consider me or my work an option if there's errors on my homepage, so I need to make sure that it is fully functional in many devices and conditions. In other words, I need to make sure the homepage is functional and makes people want to stay.

        I can add a paragraph with a question and the answer to it to relate with my customers or employer needs and let them know I can answer to that need. In need for a web designer? You've arrived to the right website.
        
        I can add a paragraph that includes the main languages and knowldege I know since that could be one of the main things they might be loking for. It is important to make it big enough to draw attention to it without stealing the attention from what I think is the most important thing which is the style and over all organization of the page. 

        I can add a paragraph that has my contact information, it is vital that people know how to get in touch with me, I need to add hyperlinks to my social media profiles so they can easily contact me.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        This page is my introduction, it will work as a presentation letter and a curricular page, however I don't want it to just be a page full of text, I would rather it to be something more dynamic, something that while it talks about my achievements and professional career also lets people know of who I am as a person, or who they'll be working with, not only the capacities I have but also my style and personality. What's important to me is that they notice more than just the words written on the page. I will make sure this section of my site includes enough images and resources to make it interesting. I'm thinking in dividing the page into three main sections, who I am (style and personality), my academic achievements and my professional career as well as experience. 
        
        I will include a section to talk about who I am, some basic information like where I am from, a summary of my life and things I like. (My name is Abraham Galicia, I was born in Mexico City and I am passionate about learning new things I enjoy anything that brings peace and a space to listen to my soul and whatever God might want to tell me. I love to work as a web designer because is the perfect combination of my passion for technology and my passion for creating).

The sections about professional career will include my main achievements and remarks.

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be completely focused on my work as a web designer. Initially it will be a bit empty, but eventually I want it to be a hub page for all the relevant work I've made through out my career. As with the other pages I will make sure the styling and organization is more important than the words being used. I plan to use the first image as a background image. I liked it because it made me think

        I will include at least three entries with introductions of what the pages are and the story behind. Why I took the proyect, how was the experience of developing it, and results, grades and later on results that I can share from former customers, either statistics or reviews from people.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>         
        I will add social media links in the header and contact info and direct links in the bottom. Colors and text will be defined later.

      <h3>Portfolio page</h3>
      <p>         
        This page will grow as my projects grow, initially I will include the water rafting page and one of the challenge pages we created during this semester. I will be using the first image as a background for this one.
