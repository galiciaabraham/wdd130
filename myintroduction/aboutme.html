                        <p>This is a little bit about myself. My name is Abraham Galicia, I am 23 years old and I love learning new things! I am married and I recently learned that I'll be a father of twins! I was born in Mexico City but I've lived in Brazil, the US,different cities in Mexico and as you might've guessed I consider myself someone that can easily adapt to new cultures, rules, and living and working styles.(And yes... I speak spanish, english and portuguese and currently I'm learning french!)</p>

                    <p>I've dedicated my professional life to the IT industry. After voluntarily serving as a missionary for the church I attend to for 2 years I decided to use the language skills I had learned and applied for a job as an IT techinician and that was the beggining of my career in the IT field. I've worked for Michelin and BMW as an IT service desk agent handleling both end-user level issues and high priority tickets that could affect the workflow of the companies. I love hard work and technology! I recently got the achievement of succesfully handleling over 700 tickets in a little less than 6 weeks. I consider myself someone that loves helping and learning from it. </p>

                    <p>Another thing you should know about me is that I am in love with nature and it's style, I take inspiration from the things God has created for us. I think there's no better solution than going out for a walk and enjoy the answers that are already around us. I hope you're ok with me stealing ideas from the nature that's around us!  </p>
