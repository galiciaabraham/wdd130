                    <p>This is a website I created as part of an assignment for my WDD130 class in BYU Idaho, We had to create a page for a Water Rafting website. I designed the logo and it was very fun to complete. This was a matter of fact my first webpage ever! I decided to include so you can compare where my skills started as a web designer.</p>

                    <p>As a newly born programmer for now my skills are not as many as I plan them to be, but you can be sure that whatever I don't know I will learn it! For now I can offer efficiency in HTML, CSS and Python languages, I am on the path to learn Ruby, JavaScript and C++, I expect to get a degree in applied technology by the end of 2024. But even with a degree I plan to make of learning programming a life style.</p>

                    <p>I consider customer satisfaction a part of my portfolio because it is an integral part of my work policy. Ever since I was a child my parents taught me that when you don't have a product for your customer you never say you don't have it, you say you will get it for him.</p>
